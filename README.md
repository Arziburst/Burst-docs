Burst is the perfect template for react web applications.

Typescript, Webpack, React, Redux are the basis of most SPA applications, and here they are already fully and conveniently configured. Simple and flexible React architecture with customized routing. Also, Redux is configured with DDD approach, which makes it possible to generate boilerplate code in a couple of steps.

Ready to use, just waiting for you!

## Architecture

Burst has original architecture. Before installing, you can see files and folders. One have a lot of resolves, it can make your development easier. You don't have to think where to create an entity, but just develop an application.

First important the folder is [`scripts`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/scripts), this folder has folders for Webpack and generate files. If you want, you can change Webpack's config for your project and generate's config.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201121086-1a355bee-b208-4e8d-a703-171958558d69.png)

Next important folder is [`src`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src). Main file of [`src`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src) is [`index.tsx`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/index.tsx), this file is the main entry for all components and other optional files.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201333507-8c704c45-d79d-4a9b-9953-e07c4deaf46f.png)

Then folder [`view`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view) of [`src`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src). We have to abstract codes and that folder for only UI. This gives us a clear structure that we can easily control UI.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201333741-1ab27311-e845-4517-b43c-81b92fe6a091.png)

The folder has [`index.tsx`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/view/index.tsx), it is a main entry for UI. Main component of one is [`<Routes />`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/e233ca7683eba08adc08676997e716124efdad86/src/view/index.tsx#L38) from the folder [`routes/index.tsx`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/e233ca7683eba08adc08676997e716124efdad86/src/view/routes/index.tsx#L11).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201338109-b5eb18a4-a97d-4341-8f2a-b0db15d48831.png)

If you open that folder, you can see those routes are two types, [`Public`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/view/routes/Public.tsx) and [`Private`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/view/routes/Private.tsx). Different routes need to split pages for public and private. Also, the routes consist of `<Route />` to render components. It looks like [this...](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/view/routes/Public.tsx)

```typescript
// ./src/view/routes/Public.tsx

export const Public: FC = () => {
    return (
        <Routes>
            <Route
                element = { <Pages.Root /> }
                path = { book.ROOT }
            />
            {/* MarkerGen route */}
            <Route
                element = {
                    <Navigate
                        replace
                        to = { book.ROOT }
                    />
                }
                path = '*'
            />
        </Routes>
    );
};
```

**Note:** sometimes you will see comments with the word [`MarkerGen`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/84d2b7a6f9fa6bd383dd4c25fa666576d43fe184/src/view/routes/Public.tsx#L18). Those comments are needed to generate ([./scripts/generate/index.ts](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/scripts/generate/index.ts)) and if you want to all work right, you have to don't remove those comments.

Then the folder [`pages`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/pages). One has pages, for example [`Root`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/pages/Root). Those pages can use [`components`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/components), [`containers`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/containers) and [`elements`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/elements). The file [`index.tsx`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/view/pages/Root/index.tsx) need for UI and [`styles.ts`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/view/pages/Root/styles.ts) need for styles. The Burst use to library [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201361260-db116622-66f8-4b11-a740-d5fa2756f19f.png)

Next folders are [`components`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/components), [`containers`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/containers), [`elements`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/elements) and these folders are divided into logical entities. The folder [`components`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/components) are independent and reusable block of JSX. The folder [`containers`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/containers) are independent and reusable containers, container can wrap `components` or `elements`. The folder  [`elements`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/view/elements) as components, but element it only part of component, it can be button or input. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201369806-3248e7fd-2994-424e-8815-7a92bb6ff0d9.png)

The folder [`assets`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/assets) for images, fonts and [`themes`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/assets/themes) (global variables, example colors or styles)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201625132-1962164c-29b4-4183-9c9e-e985fd53891f.png)


**Note:** if you want to use images, you have to import they in `ts` or `tsx` file, [example](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/e233ca7683eba08adc08676997e716124efdad86/src/view/elements/HelloBurst.tsx#L48).

```typescript
import yourImage from "assets/images/YOUR_IMAGE.png";

const Component = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <img src = { yourImage } />
        </div>
    );
};
```

Or if you need to use that image in several files, you have to import image once in `ts` file, then where you use image, you have to use next path `assets/YOUR_IMAGE.png`.

```typescript
<img src = "assets/YOUR_IMAGE.png" />
```

Next the folder [`tools`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/tools), this folder consist of custom hooks and utils. For example, it can be utils for validation inputs.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201644142-c2e70d68-7f84-4bf9-9301-9db1f2531805.png)

Next important folder is [`init`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/init), this folder has folder [`@types`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/init/@types) for types. File [`constants.ts`
](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/master/src/init/index.ts) consists of global constants, for example [`name application`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/e233ca7683eba08adc08676997e716124efdad86/src/init/constants.ts#L5) or [`URL for server`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/blob/e233ca7683eba08adc08676997e716124efdad86/src/init/constants.ts#L2). If you have global constants, you have to keep here your constants.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201649148-5bdbc1c5-10a9-4938-a02f-0cc54acc72ae.png)

The folder [`redux`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/init/redux), this folder consists of Redux store that holds the complete state tree of application from the folder [`bus`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/bus), root Saga aggregates multiple Sagas to a single entry point for the sagaMiddleware to run and Thunk's middleware.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33392042/201657040-5e4dc0f6-cc8f-4ca8-8862-2807b61b821f.png)

Last the folder [`bus`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/bus), it is entity, slice of store. This folder has two kinds of entities, the [`client`](https://github.com/Arziburst/Burst/tree/master/src/bus/client) entity for local actions, example switch sidebar for mobile or switch action online user. And entities for remotely actions (you have to use `npm run gen` for creating new entity).

## Deploy

```sh
npm run build                            /* generate lightweight bundle */
docker build -t [dokerId]/[imageName] .  /* create docker image based on build */
docker push [dokerId]/[imageName]        /* push docker image to dockerHub */
```
